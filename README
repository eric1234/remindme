A UI plugin that lays on top of authlogic to provide "Forgot My Password"
functionality. Just add to your login page:

   <%= link_to 'Forgot My Password', new_password_path %>

When they click the link they will be asked for their e-mail. Once
entered if they are a valid user they will be sent a link that will
allow them to reset their password.

This package requires Rails 3.x. If you are still on Rails 2.x see
version 0.0.3 of this gem.
